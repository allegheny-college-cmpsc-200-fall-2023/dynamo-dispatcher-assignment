# Dynamo Dispatcher: General report

Deepening our knowledge of the stack, in these activitives we're exploring:

* new functional opportunities with the stack
* an introduction to the link register and new forms of program branching
* bit shifting to leverage the most significant and least significant bits (MSB/LSB)
* dynamic subroutine calls consistent with our broader understanding of program execution

## Across all activities in this set of exercises, describe the various ways/purposes for which you've used the stack.

`TODO`

## `dynamo` proposed a new way to consider bit shifting; explain how this application is different than your use of shifting with the CARDIAC.

> Be sure to extend beyond just the syntax differences; CARDIAC wasn't a digital system, so how is it different in ARM Assembly?

`TODO`

## In `sifter`, what was the benefit of using `BL`, `BX`, et al. versus traditional comparison and conditional branching?

`TODO`

### Though a more complex cognitive operation, does it simplify our programs? Why or why not?

## Follow the `sifter` to the deepest point of the stack (i.e. when it was fullest).

> Describe the values in general terms rather than strict registers or values. For example:
> * Value of `LR` pointing to `sifter` subroutine
> * Current of number from `numbers` array in iteration
